2. FACE AND EYE DETECTION

•	Implemented Open-CV based Deep Learning models to detect Human Faces and Eyes across a large Data Set of Images and Videos sourced from Kaggle.
  
   Here, I took a human face of Prime Minister of India 'Narendra Modi' as an example.
     
•	Achieved a 95% accuracy rate and reduced detection time by 75%.

•	Tools: Open-CV, Keras, TensorFlow, Joblib, Pickle.
